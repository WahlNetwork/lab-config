and fix configuration drift in your VMware vSphere environment.\nSYNTAX\nInvoke-Vester [[-Config] ] [[-Test] ] [-Remediate] [[-XMLOutputFile] ] [-PassThru]\n [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]\nDESCRIPTION\nInvoke-Vester will run each test it finds and report on discrepancies.\nIt compares actual values against the values you supply in a config file,\nand can fix them immediately if you include the -Remediate parameter.\nIf you are not already connected to the vCenter server defined in the\nconfig file, Invoke-Vester will prompt for credentials to connect to it.\nInvoke-Vester then calls Pester to run each test file.\nThe test files\nleverage PowerCLI to gather values for comparison/remediation.\nEXAMPLES\n-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------\nInvoke-Vester -Verbose\nUsing the default config file at \\Vester\\Configs\\Config.json,\nVester will run all included tests inside of \\Vester\\Tests.\nVerbose output will be displayed on the screen.\nIt outputs a report to the host of all passed and failed tests.\n-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------\nInvoke-Vester -Config C:\\Tests\\Config.json -Test C:\\Tests\\\nVester runs all *.Vester.ps1 files found underneath the C:\\Tests\\ directory,\nand compares values to the config file in the same location.\nIt outputs a report to the host of all passed and failed tests.\n-------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------\n$DNS = Get-ChildItem -Path Z:\\ -Filter *dns*.Vester.ps1 -File -Recurse\nPS C:\\>(Get-ChildItem -Path Z:\\ -Filter *.json).FullName | Invoke-Vester -Test $DNS\nGet all Vester tests below Z:\\ with 'dns' in the name; store in variable $DNS.\nThen, pipe all *.json files at the root of Z: into the -Config parameter.\nEach config file piped in will run through all $DNS tests found.\n-------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 --------------------------\nInvoke-Vester -Test .\\Tests\\VM -Remediate -WhatIf\nRun *.Vester.ps1 tests in the .\\Tests\\VM path below the current location.\nFor all tests that fail against the values in \\Configs\\Config.json,\n-Remediate attempts to immediately fix them to match your defined config.\n-WhatIf prevents remediation, and instead reports what would have changed.\n-------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 --------------------------\nInvoke-Vester -Config .\\Config-Dev.json -Remediate\nRun all \\Vester\\Tests\\ files, and compare values to those defined within\nthe Config-Dev.json file at the current location.\nFor all failed tests, -Remediate attempts to immediately correct your\ninfrastructure to match the previously defined values in your config file.\n-------------------------- EXAMPLE 6 --------------------------\nInvoke-Vester -XMLOutputFile .\\vester.xml\nRuns Vester with the default config and test files.\nUses Pester to send test results in NUnitXML format to vester.xml\nat your current folder location.\nOption is primarily used for CI/CD integration solutions.\nPARAMETERS\n-Config\nOptionally define a different config file to use\nDefaults to

Vester Config","keywords":"","body":"New-VesterConfig\nSYNOPSIS\nGenerates a Vester config file from settings in your existing VMware environment.\nSYNTAX\nNew-VesterConfig [[-OutputFolder] ] [-Quiet]\nDESCRIPTION\nNew-VesterConfig is designed to be a quick way to get started with Vester.\nVester needs one config file for each vCenter server it interacts with.\nTo\nhelp speed up this one-time creation process, New-VesterConfig uses PowerCLI\nto pull current values from your environment to store in the config file.\nYou'll be prompted with the list of Clusters/Hosts/VMs/etc.\ndiscovered, and\nasked to choose one of each type to use as a baseline; i.e.\n\"all my other\nhosts should be configured like this one.\" Those values are displayed\ninteractively, and you can manually edit them as desired.\nOptionally, advanced users can use the -Quiet parameter.\nThis suppresses\nall host output and prompts.\nInstead, values are pulled from the first\nCluster/Host/VM/etc.\nfound alphabetically.\nManual review afterward of the\nconfig file is strongly encouraged if using the -Quiet parameter.\nIt outputs a single Config.json file at \\Vester\\Configs, which may require\nadmin rights.\nOptionally, you can use the -OutputFolder parameter to\nspecify a different folder to store the Config.json file.\nEXAMPLES\n-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------\nNew-VesterConfig\nEnsures that you are connected to only one vCenter server.\nBased on all Vester test files found in '\\Vester\\Tests', the command\ndiscovers values from your environment and displays them, occasionally\nprompting for a selection of which cluster/host/etc.\nto use.\nOutputs a new Vester config file to '\\Vester\\Configs\\Config.json',\nwhich may require admin rights.\n-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------\nNew-VesterConfig -Quiet -OutputFolder \"$env:USERPROFILE\\Desktop\"\n-Quiet suppresses all host output and prompts, instead pulling values\nfrom the first cluster/host/etc.\nfound alphabetically.\nUpon completion, Config.json will be created on your Desktop.\nPARAMETERS\n-OutputFolder\nSelect a folder to create a new Config.json file inside\nType: Object\nParameter Sets: (All)\nAliases: \n\nRequired: False\nPosition: 1\nDefault value: \"$(Split-Path -Parent $PSScriptRoot)\\Configs\"\nAccept pipeline input: False\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n\n-Quiet\nSuppress all prompts and Write-Host.\nCreate the config file\nwith the values of the first Cluster/Host/VM/etc.\nfound.\nType: SwitchParameter\nParameter Sets: (All)\nAliases: \n\nRequired: False\nPosition: Named\nDefault value: False\nAccept pipeline input: False\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n\nINPUTS\nOUTPUTS\nNOTES\nThis command relies on the Pester and PowerCLI modules for testing.\n\"Get-Help about_Vester\" for more information.\nRELATED
