# Vester

Vester is a community project that provides an extremely light-weight approach to configuration management of your VMware environment. Store desired values for vSphere components (like clusters and hosts) in a simple config file. If the values in your config file don't match the values in your environment, you can report on--and optionally fix--those discrepancies.

Vester is written entirely in PowerShell, using [PowerCLI](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/PowerCLI/) and [Pester](https://github.com/Pester/Pester). Config files are stored as json documents that can easily live in source control.

Please visit the **[full documentation](https://wahlnetwork.github.io/Vester)** for more details.

This [three-part blog series](http://www.brianbunke.com/blog/2017/03/07/introducing-vester/) from March 2017 walks you through getting started with [Vester 1.0](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Vester/1.0.1).
